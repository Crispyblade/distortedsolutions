Cannibalism is most often practiced by rich people, but in [[Geography and Politics/District\|District]] 23 it's a common occurrence.

Most gourmets find that suffering adds to the flavor, so people being cooked alive/tortured as long as possible is a common occurrence for cannibal chefs.
Some examples include feeding people feet first into a grinder, hopped up on drugs so they can't simply fall unconscious.

Stars of the City, are only concerned with finding the "Ultimate Flavor"
Apparently they all "ate themselves to death"
