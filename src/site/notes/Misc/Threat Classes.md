Threat Classes
In the City, the Hana Association classifies and ranks certain threats and organizations based on how much people pay for it to be eliminated. Though, this usually goes hand in hand with how dangerous the threats are as well. A Special Investigator Badge is issued to Fixers undertaking cases ranked Nightmare and above, which allows them access to benefits for the duration of the task.

Also, cases in the City tend to have inconsistent threat classifications depending on whether their affecting the Backstreets or Nest. A violent organized incident in the Streets would remain at Urban Plague at best, while the same happening in a Nest would elevate it to Nightmare or even Star.

Urban Myth: Threats that are unconfirmed as to whether they exist or not, being noteworthy enough to catch the attention of the Associations. Usually an Affiliate Office or similar will investigate on their behalf, if the threat is confirmed to be real and active, they are exalted to Urban Legend.

Urban Legend: Having a widespread influence on society, their actions have made them known to nearly every person in a District. These threats are what most Associations focus on for their lower Sections, as the payout for these is good and it keeps them sharp.

Urban Plague: Threats that have influence in more than a few Districts, the mere mention of their name is sure to turn heads. Usually these include Syndicates involved with the Fingers.

Urban Nightmare: This threat class is capable of affecting nearly every District, whether it be Nest or Backstreets. Their removal is of the highest priority, and even the Wings will send their best.

Star of the City: These are usually the most dangerous and powerful threats to threaten City Society. Color Fixers and the Hana Association are typically the first to be sent after these, as they have the skill and expertise to handle them.

Stars of the City are often seen as something that the lowly citizens and dredges aspire to be, not to become exactly like them per say, rather to reach that same level of recognition, fear, and respect. It's the main reason the Head does not go to wipe every Star out, as they accept these aspirations. Even though many Stars are felled, there will always be more to rise.

Impurity: A rank only which only can be granted by the Head, Impurities are Stars that are seen as violations to the City and its laws, and are typically banished to the Outskirts by the Head's forces through the Territory Expulsion Procedure
