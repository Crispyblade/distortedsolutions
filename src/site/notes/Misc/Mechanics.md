Interception Rules:
At the start of the round, the abnormality declares their targets. A person with higher speed can choose to "intercept" that one attack, once a person.


Damage Types:
Physical
Bleed(x): On a person's turn after being inflicted by bleed, if that character moves, attacks, or does anything other than stand still they receive damage directly to their HP equal to x. Each movement or attack causes bleed damage to occur. Every time bleed damage occurs, the stack is halved. If the character does nothing, the bleed stack is halved.

Burn(x): At the end of a person's turn after being inflicted with burn, take damage equal to x, and remove all burn. A person can use their action to put out the burn instead. Burn ignores armor, protection, resistances, and weaknesses

Sinking(x): The next time the character is hit, they take typeless sanity damage equal to sinking stacks, then remove all stacks of sinking. Sanity for the sake of this game, is dealt to your humanity stat. Units with no humanity will instead take bonus damage equal to the humanity that would be lost, such as abnormalities. Sinking ignores armor, protection, resistances, and weaknesses
At 30 humanity, all dice power is reduced by 1, and the victim takes 2 fragile tokens.
At 20 humanity, all dice power is reduced by 3, and the victim takes 5 fragile tokens.
At 10 humanity, all dice power is reduced by 6, and the victime takes 6 fragile tokens. Additionally, there is a 50% chance the victim will skip their turn.
At 0 humanity, the victim will become staggered. After recovering they will be reset to 40 humanity. 

Rupture(x): The next time the character is hit, they take typeless hp damage equal to rupture stacks, then remove all stacks of rupture. Rupture ignores armor, protection, resistances, and weaknesses

Smoke(x): Stacks up to 10. You take x more damage from physical attacks. All dice gain +1 power at 9 or more smoke. Lose 1 smoke at the end of the turn. (There are perks to negate the extra damage taken from smoke)

Toxin: Similar to bleed

Tremor(X): Affects some abilities and perks. Lose one tremor after turn end.
If character has tremor and is hit by tremor burst, they must make a stagger save equal to how many tremor stacks they had + half the stacks using Body or Endurance. If they fail, they are staggered

Example: Enemy has 16 tremor, and is hit by tremor burst. They must make a DV 16+8 + Body or Endurance save


Charge: Used and generated by specific abilities and equipment. The character’s equipment and perks determine the storage limit. All charge is lost upon entering or exiting combat, without perks that say otherwise.

Status Effects:

Adrenaline: Character can’t be sent into Bleedout, gets +2 to all dice, take half damage from all physical attacks, gain 1 more ROF

Accuracy (x): x to all attack rolls

Anti-Recovery(x): Cannot recover Hp for (x) turns. 

Bind(x): Mov are reduced by x

Blinded: Target cannot use any ability or or other maneuver which relies on sight, but is immune to effects which rely on the target seeing them.

Blurred: If the character with Blurred has allies without Blurred, then they cannot be targeted by any enemy attacks. Mass Attacks and Counters still function normally against them.

Chilled(x): 1 Chill is lost at the start of each turn. At the start of the turn, if the character has 4 or more Chill, gain 2 Bind and Feeble. If the character has 6 or more Chill, gain 2 Immobilize, and remove all Chill from self at the start of the next Scene. Stacks of Burn negate stacks of Chill

Deafened: Target cannot use any ability or or other maneuver which relies on sound, but is immune to effects which rely on the target hearing them.

Disarm(x): Reduce x damage reduction

Endurance(x): Add x to damage reduction

Energy Seal(x): Target has (x) fewer ROF for a weaspon until the end of the next turn. (minimum of 1 ROF)

Erosion(x): Take (x) damage at the end of each combat turn, then lose one point of erosion. When taking a hit, take bonus damage equal to the amount of Erosion.

Feeble(x): Reduce all attack rolls by (x), to a minimum of 1

Fragile(x): Target takes (x) more hp damage from attacks, before resistances/weaknesses.

Haste(x): Mov is enhanced by x, eva

Immobilize(x): One square counts as 2 Mov, sprinting is unavailable for x turns

Obscured Vision(x): The character cannot see beyond (x) tiles around them. Not being able to see something means that it is not targetable with melee maneuvers and ranged maneuvers gain a -3 power penalty to all offensive dice.

Paralysis(x): The first (x) dice target rolls in the next turn have -3 to result, the change to the roll from paralysis is counted for any effects which specify a “natural roll”. Movement speed is halved. 

Powernull: Target is unaffected by power-related effects until the end of their turn.
Powernull can also apply to individual abilities, maneuvers, or dice. When powernulled, a die only rolls the base value and dice on the ability plus the dice from the user’s weapon’s dice.
	Whenever something mentions being “Nullified” then this effect is used.

Poise: When attacking roll a d20. If you roll under your poise count, this attack does 20% more damage. Poise decreases by one on a critical hit and one on turn end.

Protection(x): Target takes (x) less physical damage from attacks, before resistances or weaknesses.

Resilience(x): The character can prevent (x) instances of status effects being inflicted on them. 1 stack is consumed per stack of status inflicted and the character with resilience can decide whether or not to spend a stack when inflicted with a status effect.


Sanity Fragile(x): Target takes (x) more sanity damage from attacks, before resistances/weaknesses.

Sanity Protection(x): Target takes (x) less sanity damage from attacks, before resistances/weaknesses.

Shield(x): Shields count as HP but are depleted first and can go over your maximum HP. Shields are normally lost at the end of each turn.

Staggered: Players lose their action and turn all resistances to Fatal (double damage from ALL ATTACKS) for the current and next turn. Enemies lose that and are also unable to use any maneuvers or movement the current and next turn. Simply, you skip your turn, can't evade, and take double damage.

Strength(x): Add +(x) to all damage rolls
