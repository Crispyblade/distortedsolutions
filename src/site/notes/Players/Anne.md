Girl is a soft hearted person. She wants to help people and feels that she can't do that in the nest. Her family is researchers and most of them consider her an odd but clever child that they care about. She is closest to her older sister who helped teach her the profession of healing. She 'ran away' from home after leaving a note. All of the family already knew she was planning on leaving and while concerned felt it was something she had to do and quietly wished her luck.


Reason for becoming a fixer:
Became a fixer because it was the most versatile and would let her reach the most people and districts with good reason. Plus she has a desire to research within reason.









BELOW IS BANNED FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT ANNE































Anne was a child that could not get along with others. In her early years she would be looked at by other kids with apprehension, or disgust. When she spoke what was on her mind, she was berated for saying something gross or dumb. Other children would call her a mistake. They would say she is hated. They would say she’s a monster. They would say she should not have been born. Someday she even started to believe them. (Around age 4-5) When Anne started to feel like everything the others said was true she started to find faults in herself. Things she hated about herself. Things she knew were mistakes. Things she knew made her a monster. Things she knew meant she should not have been born. So she stopped going out, stopped seeing others, stopped letting her disgusting existence affect the people around her. She locked herself in her room. Her only companions were books brought by her family and any hobby she found in them. She felt empty, cold and numb. Her parents tried to look for her every day for the first few months. They would ask her if she was feeling ok. Ask her what's wrong. Ask her if she wanted to go out. She would respond that she was fine. There was nothing wrong. She is busy and can’t go out. Her sister Irene was almost the same as her parents. She would come to ask if Anne was ok. If she wanted to go out. If she wanted to play. Anne would give the same responses. She was fine. She was too busy to go out. She couldn’t play. But every time she said she couldn’t play, Irene would just smile and say, then I’ll play here and you can watch. Irene would come every day, without fail. She eventually stopped asking questions too often and would just play with Anne every day for some time. Anne didn’t understand why her sister would want to play with something like her so she turned to the only thing she could to learn, her books. She searched and searched and searched. Every day her sister would come play and every day she would try to get closer to her answer. For three years she searched until she found something that might tell her. Books on psychology, and biology. Books about the brain, how it works, creatures behaviors. Systems that were supposed to tell her why people act the way they do, but she couldn’t quite understand. One thing, however, caught her attention. She a short line in a small book that stuck in her head and wouldn’t get out. ‘It's better to be honest about your feelings. Especially to those who love you.’ (8ish years old) “See you tomorrow sis. I love you.” Was something Anne heard every day when Irene left her room. She kept going around and around in her head, wondering if she should answer those questions. Wondering if her sister really did love her and if so why? For two more years she struggled with this going through her head, until one day, on a very ordinary afternoon, following a familiar routine, Irene asked if Anne was feeling alright. Anne burst into tears as she hugged her sister and started to rant about everything she felt. Everything that was wrong with her. Why she was a mistake. Why she hated herself. Why she was a monster. Why she should never have been born. Irene just held her as she cried while patting her head. She didn’t refute anything Anne said, nor did she affirm it. She responded by asking Anne to play a game. A game called ‘What’s good about me?’ A game where you find things about yourself that you like and tell the other person. A game similar to something Anne read but she couldn’t quite remember where. For the sake of her sister Anne would try her best. For four years Anne would try thinking of things she liked about herself, things that made her happy for herself, things that she felt were good about herself. They started off superficial, that she can read well, that she has a good family. But over time they became deeper. She liked how she could get interested in little things. She liked that she could still ask about her family members day. She liked that she could still smile even in the cold and empty world. She liked that she could be honest. And gradually that cold world started to warm up. She came out of her room more. She could have conversations with the people she cared about. She started to care about herself again and started worrying about others again. She started to be happy with this world and lasting warmth. Different from the fleeting and short lived bursts from when she read a funny book, or completed a project. Different from the weak and illusory warmth from imagining another person’s story. From reading about the hero who saved the world. This warmth was hers, and it was something she cherished. (10-12ish years old) Finally, one day, Anne wanted to go outside. To see the warm world for herself. But she was still held back and afraid. Afraid of the people she now realized had lied to her. Afraid of the scorn she would face for being herself. Afraid of hearing those words and being sent back into the cold and dark abyss. But once again, Irene came to help her open that door. She dragged Anne outside saying “I’m going shopping and you're coming with me”. So outside they went. Anne watched Irene talking to others with a smile. Others would respond the same. Anne would stammer out some responses when spoken to worried about the inevitable attack, but it never came. Some would still look at her with somewhat strange eyes, but most would not. No one scorned her, no one screamed at her, and no one called her a mistake. Anne was overjoyed. She realized that, just like with that cold dark place, she was hurting herself more than others hurting her. She had to stand up, to be brave, and to face what the future held the best she could. Over the last years until the present, Anne learned about the world, about people, about a lot of things. She found passion in helping others. In the idea that the world can be cruel, can be cold, and can be harsh, but there is still meaning in it. Pockets of warmth that can be found if you look for it. Passion in helping others even if she fails, knowing that a helping hand in dark times can be worth more than the world. Knowing that people can be good just as much as evil if given the chance. Wanting to help others as she felt she was helped herself. To make the world just a little bit brighter even in the face of that endless abyss.
