Girl is a soft hearted person. She wants to help people and feels that she can't do that in the nest. Her family is researchers and most of them consider her an odd but clever child that they care about. She is closest to her older sister who helped teach her the profession of healing. She 'ran away' from home after leaving a note. All of the family already knew she was planning on leaving and while concerned felt it was something she had to do and quietly wished her luck.


Reason for becoming a fixer:
Became a fixer because it was the most versatile and would let her reach the most people and districts with good reason. Plus she has a desire to research within reason.
