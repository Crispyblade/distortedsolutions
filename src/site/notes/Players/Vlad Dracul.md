Born in [[Businesses and Organizations/J Corp\|J Corp]] [[Businesses and Organizations/Nest\|Nest]]
Is a [[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]]

"Just because he's from a nest doesn't mean he ever felt like doing this type of work until recently. I feel like he had a pretty cushy easy life until now. Until he lost Lyza..."

Vlad cares about most is [[Characters/Lyza\|Lyza]]. She allegedly died 40 years ago but he can't really accept it. The only thing really keeping him going and knowingly being a blight on mankind is the hope to find her reincarnation or something. He doesn't necessarily believe in reincarnation, but he hopes

As for Lyza, you can do what you want with her. I have an idea for her as a backup character, but if you think of something else, go for it.

Vampire Prince falls in love with a woman fated to be turned into a blood bag, rescues her, helps her escape. They meet up again later. Then somehow his mother finds out and makes her "disappear", and tells her son she's dead

Family:
I'm thinking they might not know who Dracula actually was. The pop culture icon at least, but they got his fashion and mannerisms from somewhere. It's very common for them to lure an unsuspecting human into their dwelling before consuming them or blood bagging them.


I think instead of the kings, the clan might officially be called [[Businesses and Organizations/The Counts\|The Counts]]. Unless that's too on the nose

Something Vlad wouldn't know. The head of the Counts, Maria Dracul, more commonly known as Lady Dracula, or simply the Countess actually fell in love with a human a few centuries back. Eventually something terrible would befall him at the hands of other humans and she would grow to despise humans as a whole. Thinking they're fit for nothing more than to be bloodbags. (Yeah I'm kind of thinking of doing the castlevania thing)He could be called Renfield.

Lyza is a human. A bloodfiend and human relationship is taboo. He eventually left of his own accord. But he's a fixer now because he believes he has a better chance finding Lyza that way if she is reincarnated

I feel like her war against the humans would be more subtle in this setting though, because the higher ups could easily put a stop to it
I feel like Lady Dracula would be the type to decorate her throne room with the skulls of failed hunters

Imagine if Lyzas reincarnation was as a belmont or something
