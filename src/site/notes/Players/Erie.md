"Anyway my brain tells me Erie's generation is probably closer to the higher end of the spectrum based entirely on vibes alone. That and the fact she occasionally forgets to be afraid of water"

Looks early-mid 20's

[[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]] with amnesia after being shot in the head

Anne's Notes:
Has issues with shrapnel being stuck in her head.
As a blood fiend has is immune to diseases.
Does not know of any allergies they may have.
Has massive headaches and frequently interrupted sleep due to dreams.
Occasionally has muscle spasms due to parts of the brain being pushed.
Sustains physical fitness using blood and little exercise.
Has a regular diet.

Becoming a fixer
I feel like Erie did it entirely because Mercer was also doing it and it seemed like an easy way to find blood that wasn't just eviscerating the poor people population around the district
I mean Erie would explain its either that or baiting rats into attacking her because bloodbags freak her out and based on how these things typically go she probably made one by accident and it freaked both her and mercer out a little prior to becoming fixers

it's just a weird arrow and she can make a hard blood bow, it's probably something from when she got turned and just doesn't remember just that its important somehow.
Arrow is from [[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]] Hunters, might be Atelier Logic

Dealing with existential crisis

Met Mercer in K Corp after a few days after being turned. Covered in caked blood



BELOW IS BANNED FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT ERIE



























1. Origins & Background
-Erie is probably from a Nest originally god knows which, she's probably closer to someone natively from the Backstreets with how she is right now.


-Erie was likely shaped into a methodical individual by her upbringing, which is now lost. She was likely less timid and quiet before the surprise brain scrambling. Currently the only one that Erie regards as family is Mercer at this point in time. Additionally given Mercer's condition when he found Erie it's probably a small miracle that she didn't somehow end up being way worse of a person.


-Pre lead head Erie's family is likely part of the reason she ended up becoming a fang hunt office style fixer originally. Her grandfather likely made her parents lives easy and was probably a grade three or four fixer or an equivalently well paid individual and when he eventually died either of old age or worse her and her sister needed jobs and wanted to follow in his footsteps.


2. Motivations & Goals
- Originally to stop from getting kicked out of the Nest, also to follow in grandpa's footsteps. Currently it's because Mercer was doing it and because it's very complimentary to her current condition as a bloodfiend.


- Erie can't retire because of the whole not wanting to murder innocent people thing, also because she thinks bloodbags are conceptually vile.


- Erie is fighting for her friends, for herself, and more or less for her right to continue existing as a person.


3. Relationships
-Important NPCs: Family: Dead Grandfather Abraham Van Helsing, Mother Emelia Van Helsing, Father Sigmund Van Helsing, Sister Iris Van Helsing. Best Friend: Minerva Harker (likely a fellow fixer, might not buy that Erie is dead) Mentor: Grandfather (Lesson that stuck was learn to trust your gut feeling. A lesson that is likely lost on Iris.) Rival/Enemy:  Minerva’s sister, disliked Erie’s original personality, and thought she should be told to kick rocks by Minerva.


-Erie likes all of her office team mates to varying degrees, she's slightly mistrustful of Anne but has come around. She thinks Vlad needs multiple years worth of hugs and maybe therapy. She thinks Uta needs to be more mindful and needs to be treated well in order for her to have any hope of improving. She thinks Jaden is a little odd at times but a decent enough dude. She loves Mercer dearly but thinks he being in a leadership position is actively bringing his negative emotions bubbling to the surface in a way that actively makes him seem like a worse person then she views him as even if she's technically only known human Mercer for a little bit at this point.


4. Personality and beliefs
-Erie’s greatest regret is getting shot in the head, go figure. Erie’s moral line she’d never cross is she’s unwilling to attack the people she cares about, which will automatically include people she knew before she was shot in the head if / when she recognizes them.


-Pre bullets Erie probably responded to insults with sarcasm. Currently Erie will just stare at you if insulted. Pre bullets Erie actively avoided conflict. Erie now will fight if she believes it the correct option and has minimal qualms about violence based problem solving


-Erie saw… something in the very brief period where she was extremely close to dead. She doesn't remember and probably shouldn't remember. Pre bullets Erie likely had the same religious and superstitious beliefs as her family for the most part.
 
5.Past trauma and secrets
-Erie was likely mildly impacted by the smoke war and L corp wars prior to being shot in the head. Currently she's aware they happened but not the explicit details


-Erie's secret is that ever since Mercer became human again she's been having dreams where she bites him and turns him into a bloodfiend, she's not sure why she's having them and they make her very uncomfortable.


-Erie wants to help her friends. This is a mistake Erie keeps repeating as not all of her friends are shining beacons of good character or ethics.


6.Daily Life and Quirks
-Erie sleeps or lounges around the office during downtime but will often accompany others if they are going out somewhere.


-Erie’s favorite color is blue, She has a pet peeve about constant yelling, and she's generally more of a night person


-Erie would rather go to an inn, Erie is a dog person but also likes cats, her go to tavern order would probably be a burger.


7.Hypotheticals
-If Erie suddenly had money the office would be moving somewhere nice and she would treat her friends occasionally.


-If a child asked Erie for help she would do her best to help the child.


-If Erie sees a random arrest happening unless it's someone she knows she isn't going to attempt to get involved.


8.Legacy & Future
-Erie wants to be remembered as she was and as she is. Ultimately she doesn't want to be remembered as a monster even if she’d never admit it on her own.


-If Erie was going to die tomorrow she'd take everyone out for a fun day off and try not to let it set in. She'd also probably make it a point to be honest and tell everyone how she feels about them before she kicks the bucket.


-If Erie retires it's probably gonna be a soft retirement where she just trys to help out around the city a little and helps out lower grade fixers with stuff to meet people.
