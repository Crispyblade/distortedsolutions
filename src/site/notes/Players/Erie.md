"Anyway my brain tells me Erie's generation is probably closer to the higher end of the spectrum based entirely on vibes alone. That and the fact she occasionally forgets to be afraid of water"

[[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]] with amnesia after being shot in the head

Anne's Notes:
Has issues with shrapnel being stuck in her head.
As a blood fiend has is immune to diseases.
Does not know of any allergies they may have.
Has massive headaches and frequently interrupted sleep due to dreams.
Occasionally has muscle spasms due to parts of the brain being pushed.
Sustains physical fitness using blood and little exercise.
Has a regular diet.

Becoming a fixer
I feel like Erie did it entirely because Mercer was also doing it and it seemed like an easy way to find blood that wasn't just eviscerating the poor people population around the district
I mean Erie would explain its either that or baiting rats into attacking her because bloodbags freak her out and based on how these things typically go she probably made one by accident and it freaked both her and mercer out a little prior to becoming fixers
