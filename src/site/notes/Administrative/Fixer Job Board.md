My floor contains books pertaining to fairy tales and as the name suggests, how people and fiction interact with the real world. As im sure you are aware, the abnormalities we contain in the books have begun to "leak out". Currently this is mostly harmless, but im afraid the abnormalities contained on my floor have been a bit, problematic. Specifically people have been "stuck" in their dreams as ive been told. Ive attached more details to this letter, if you could suppress these abnormalities im sure Angela would reward you quite handsomly. I also provide excellent imported coffee and make a great conversationlist if that proves enticing. Sincerely - Chesed
