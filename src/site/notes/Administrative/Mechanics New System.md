Advances
An Advance lets a character do one of the following. Remember that no Trait may be raised above its racial maximum (usually d12).

Gain a new Edge or power

Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than its linked attribute one die type.

Increase two skills that are lower than their linked attributes by one die type each (including new skills the character didn’t have before at d4).

Increase one attribute by a die type. This option may only be taken once per Rank (see Rank, below). Legendary characters may raise an attribute every other Advance, up to the racial maximum.

Permanently remove a Minor Hindrance, or reduce a Major Hindrance to a Minor (if possible). With the GM’s permission, and if it makes sense, two Advances may be saved up and spent to remove a Hindrance. The player and GM should work out how and when this happens. Perhaps the shocking death of an ally triggers a change in attitude, the hero puts real effort into improving harmful behavior, or might even seek professional help during downtime between missions.
