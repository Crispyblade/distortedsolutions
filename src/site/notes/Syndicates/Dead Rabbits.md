A Subsidiary of the Ring (specifically the Fauvists) that were originally a small gang in the Backstreets of T Corp. They were noticeably less cruel than most Syndicates, acting more as vigilantes for the weak and poor. Eventually they managed to attract the attention of the Ring, who brought them into the fold.

Outfit: Dull Brown and Dull Red suit coats, with a Rusty Orange stitched rabbit mask.
