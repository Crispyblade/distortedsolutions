"Picturing a world where the oppressed can escape from the exploitative dominion of the ruling class and find liberation in the truest sense" - Sonya

The Yurodiviye (Russian: Юро́дивые, Juródivyje; Hangul: 유로지비, Yurojibi), are a Syndicate led by Sonya, aiming to redistribute goods from the rich to the needy and widely prevent the concentration of wealth.

Yurodiviye was founded by Sonya and Rodion in the Backstreets of District 25 in response to the poor circumstances of those without wealth. Individual members are known as "Yurodivy", and exhibit magnanimous ideals rarely seen in the harsh, greedy landscape of the City — though they seem to carry these out in questionable ways.

The Syndicate was formed as a result of dissatisfaction with the way the poor of District 25's Backstreets only ever got poorer while the pawnbrokers only got richer. With charming speeches consisting of big words, Sonya managed to rally all kinds of people under the promise of paving a better world, and together, they organized Yurodiviye. With his group, Sonya aimed for a world where the destitute could escape from the oppression and exploitation of the ruling class and at last find true liberation.

However, according to Rodya, the Syndicate ultimately warped into an organization that cared more for debating about how best to change the streets and the Nest, rather than actually going out and helping those in need. Sonya believed that it was only the future which could be changed, and focused exclusively on what could be improved going forward.
