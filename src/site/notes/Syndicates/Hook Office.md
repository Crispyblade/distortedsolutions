They are the second Fixer group contacted by the Invitation and are the fourth group of Guests to enter the Library

Taein is the "young and talented" star Fixer of Hook Office, whose presence in the Hook Fixers' former Syndicate allowed it to achieve notoriety.  He is somewhat arrogant and cold, but casual with his teammates. In combat, Taein uses bionic weaponry from Union Co. in the form of two scythes attached to his back, controlled without needing to use his hands.

McCullin was one of the leaders of the Hook Fixers' former killer Syndicate and is now a Fixer for Hook Office. He wears a white smirking mask which hides his face and has a calm and baleful demeanor. In combat, McCullin uses a large machete that he wields in one hand.

Naoki was one of the leaders of the Hook Fixers' former killer Syndicate and is now a Fixer for Hook Office. bShe knows how to pick the proper equipment available for themselves. Thoughtful and sometimes calm, she seems to show equal amounts of hostility and ambition to kill and get money. Naoki fights using a pair of machetes that are wired to her backpack.

Normal Members:
