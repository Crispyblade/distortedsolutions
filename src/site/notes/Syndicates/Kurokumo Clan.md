"Whatever goods the head honchos take interest in are naturally gonna attract the attention of those below them. The Thumb or the Index probably won't take action for now, but their subordinates are nothing to sneeze at."
The Kurokumo Clan is one of the twenty subsidiaries of The Thumb. The Kurokumo Clan is notable for its focus on swordplay, and is recognizable by their extensive augmentation tattoos, which depict the black clouds they are named after. Their main form of revenue is extortion, such as requiring tolls for passage between territories, or payments from Nest citizens in exchange for "protection". In recent times, the Clan has also been interested in the dealing of artifacts such as Monoliths.

The Kurokumo Clan originates from the eastern quarter of the City, although it is active in the southern quarter as well. After the collapse of Lobotomy Corporation, the Kurokumo Clan went into frequent conflict with other Syndicates in an attempt to control the territory of Nest L. In recent times, the Clan has been active in the Backstreets of District 20 as well, under the command of Captain Jun. Notable rival Syndicates of theirs are the Blade Lineage, which they have been competing with both in District 12 and District 19, and the Rusted Chains.

Like many other Syndicates, the Kurokumo Clan presents a strict hierarchy: at its head is the Patriarch (組長, Kumichō), under which are his Captains (頭, Kashira), which command groups composed of their henchmen, or Wakashu (若衆, Wakashū). At the death of a Captain, the next Captain will inherit their team, as well as the Captain's sword, the Kokuuntō.

The Patriarch of the Kurokumo Clan is a famed swordsman, who used to be numbered among the Ten Blades of the East. The Patriarch lost his claim to the title during the events of Library of Ruina: following Captain Sayo's team's failure to complete a mission on behalf of the Thumb, his left hand was cut off, severely hindering his swordplay.
