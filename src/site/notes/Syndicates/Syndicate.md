Description
Being the unlawful counterparts of Fixers, Syndicates are made up of thugs and gangsters who commit several shady, dubious activities often linked to organized crime and share a common goal. They tend try to make names for themselves in the Backstreets which they primarily operate in by black markets, contraband, trafficking, and hit jobs to name a few. While they can do jobs Fixers usually are hired to do, it's more risky trusting a Syndicate than an Office or Association. Syndicates formed by denizens of the City and come in different seizes and scopes. Countless of smaller sizes exist, to the extent where Roland considered there to be as many as the amount of Fixers that exist.

While Syndicates are generally viewed as criminal organizations, not all Syndicates are actually bad though as some choose not to take the responsibilities and restrictions that being a Fixer of an Office or Association brings. Certain Syndicates even exist to hunt down other Syndicates, operating more like unofficial Offices if not resembling something akin to vigilante groups. The guaranteed way a Syndicate to gain power is to raid and wipe out Offices, the bigger and more seasoned an Office is, the larger the infamy is gained.

Also, Wings sometimes hire Syndicates as thugs to handle business they can't do officially. Syndicates are sorted in a social hierarchical system, with their powerful bosses dictating Backstreets at the top, but the ones that stands above all of them are the Five Fingers who are labelled as the "Stars of the City".

  
Syndicates can do work Fixers normally do, It's just that trusting a Syndicate is riskier than hiring an Office, as they lack the need of "obligations" and "contracts". Most groups are made up of like-minded criminals, or "Rats" who have gained enough power to pose a threat.  
  
Not all Syndicates are bad though, some simply don't want the responsibilities and restrictions that being an Office Fixer brings. Some Syndicates even exist to hunt down other Syndicates, like a Vigilante group.  
Though the surefire way of gaining power as a Syndicate is to raid and wipe out Fixer Offices, the bigger and more seasoned an Office is, the larger the infamy gain is. Syndicates are handled in a hierarchy system, with powerful bosses dictating Districts at the top, but the group that stands above all of them are the "Fingers of the Backstreets".  
  
In addition, Wings sometimes hire Syndicates as thugs to handle business they can't do officially.
