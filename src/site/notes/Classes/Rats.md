"Groups of half-assed thugs that barely qualify as a Syndicate. They don’t have money or power. They’re losers who only think about making ends meet day by day.	" - Roland

The Rats are low-level street thugs who inhabit the Backstreets. Consisting of people who have failed to achieve their dreams and can only focus on daily survival, groups of Rats are far too disorganized to be considered formal Syndicates, and are not affiliated with any other large factions.

Background
Rats are considered the lowest order of criminal groups in the City, not even worthy of designation as a formal Syndicate, with the term generally applying to low-threat groups of Backstreets criminals whose strength mainly comes from their high numbers. Rats are not part of any larger organizations (be they Offices, Associations, or Syndicates,) and Rats themselves are also not one large organization. They are divided into various individual groups, or "packs", each with its own leaders, who join together for the safety of numbers.

What these packs of Rats all have in common is their day-to-day struggle for survival. The majority of Rats are people who have failed to accomplish their dreams and are left unable to pursue them, being forced to commit petty crimes and unsavory jobs such as harvesting organs from corpses in order to earn money. This gives them a negative image as failures who scavenge off of others' efforts to survive, being unable to succeed in their own pursuits. Still, this doesn't mean that all Rats do not dream. Even in the decrepit conditions of the Backstreets, some still cling to hopes of a better life and will do all they can to pursue them. Many Rats have one goal: to join a proper Syndicate in order to reap the benefits of such a group's name without being bound to the societal rules of other organizations.

Rats may be belittled as low threat, but this doesn't mean that they are harmless. Even a novice Fixer, let alone an average citizen of the Backstreets, can often be no match when faced with a pack of Rats.

Rats also seem to overhear various rumors, myths, and legends from their area and other people. Information spreads easily between Rats who take note of such rumors, whether they are confirmed or not, to plan and react to any potential changes. Other groups, like Offices and Syndicates, attempt to hear the gossip of Rats to identify new possible anomalies, threats or points of interest.
