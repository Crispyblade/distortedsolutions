The Wings
There are 26 Wings with their own Singularity technology. Each Wing controls a District, which includes the Nest and Backstreets. Each Wing's purpose is the utilization of their Singularity for managing their District and commercial use for the general populace.
Each Wing have specialized departments that ensure smooth operation, though some Wings are more specialized in certain tasks than others.

Wings can request mutual agreements with other Wings or their associates to either deal with certain issues they cannot handle, or an exchange of armaments, supplies, or personal. Wings can also hire Fixers into working for them. Though this is often a topic of contention.

Most Wings have some form of a para-military force and Fixers to use in armed conflicts, typically with rival Wings, lesser corporations, or Syndicates and monsters. These agents are usually ranked from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest rank, and 5 being the highest, though each Wing can have their own number of ranks.

Wing Collapse
In certain extreme circumstances, a Wing can end up "Collapsing". Whether due to an attack from the Head, an incident with their Singularity, or other causes, the Nest will be thrown into chaos as they tear each other apart.

The Nest slowly becomes indistinguishable from the Backstreets as residents fend for themselves, with multiple Syndicates rushing in to claim the Wing's holdings. No one typically interferes in this collapse, as the Head will simply appoint a new Wing to that Nest.

Once a new Wing is appointed, they will either buy the collapsed Nest from the holding Syndicate, or hire Fixers or other Syndicates to kick said holder out. The Nest is slowly rebuilt, and life returns to normal after a while.
