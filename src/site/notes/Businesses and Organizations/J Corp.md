Basically Las Vegas.
Their Singularity is based off of Luck


J Corp: Owns District 10. Their Singularity enables them to put a lock on anything, physically and conceptually. The polar opposite of F Corp, their "Locks" can seal containers, mental minds, and areas of space, preventing entry.
In general they are a large casino corporation that controls and highly monitors these facilities, through security cameras and using their "Locks". They staff surveillance with hundreds of workers who examine dozens of screens for any signs of cheaters.
