Replaced [[Businesses and Organizations/Old L Corp\|Old L Corp]]

Known as Lobotomy Corporation, they gathered energy by extracting Abnormalities and E.G.O created through their Singularity and Cogito. Which was the physical manifestation of the human mind and emotions. Owns District 12.  

**Lobotomy Corp:** After the Seed of Light Project's eventual success, Lobotomy HQ was transformed into The Library and all the branch facilities underwent the burial protocol. As a result, L Corp lost it's status as a Wing and District 12 was thrown into chaos as various parties rushed in to take advantage.  
The Library itself remained as a dominant structure until it's removal by [[History and Myths/The Head\|the Head]]. Currently, [[Geography and Politics/District\|District]] 12 is still without a Wing, as likely the City is still sorting out the remaining chaos.

**L Corp Agents:** Employees of L Corp, they used to work in the various facilities scattered around the City, they were responsible for managing the Abnormalities and gathering energy for the company. Although they lack in combat skills, they make up for this by utilizing EGO weapons and outfits to contend with the Abnormalities. Agents are ranked in 1-5 levels, a fully equipped level 5 ALEPH Agent is said to rival in power to a Claw.  
Outfit: They can use a variety of colorful EGO suits, but the default uniform and armband depends on their assigned Team.
