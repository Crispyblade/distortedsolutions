Known as "WARP Corp", owns District 23. They handle warping and teleportation technology, namely the WARP Train Network that runs throughout the City. Their Singularity allows them to restore things to a recorded state through manipulation of molecular and genetic structures.  
They also create rifts in space through a Singularity from a fallen Rift Wing that the trains travel through to reach their destination in under "10 seconds".
