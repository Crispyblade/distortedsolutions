Handles Nanotechnology and applications of it, most of it for medicinal and healing purposes. Owns District 11.

They are renowned for their Singularity-based medical technology used in both civilian and military settings, capable of rapid regeneration. Due to their immense influence, K Corp's Nest has a noticeably greater quality of life, and is considered one of the safer and more comfortable places to live in, even compared to other Nests.

It appears to have an odd blend between advanced modern architecture and rural German villages. They have a custom to walk outside in the rain without umbrellas on the night of a certain month every year. Had the case of the "Quercus Village" Distortion.

Singularity
K Corp's singularity revolves around Helapoiesis, a green fluid that allows for rapid physical regeneration. As long as the brain is intact, Helapoiesis can heal even the most fatal wounds. Helapoiesis is sold in the form of HP Bullets to be fired into injured combatants, injectable HP Ampules (up to 3 were needed to heal Dante's half-melted body), and ingestible Tablets that heal users overnight. Helapoiesis products also require cross-compatibility tests with its targets, or else they may suffer side effects.

K Corp laboratories also use ampule administration drones, though they only deliver ampules to eligible and/or heavily injured targets; thus K-Corp employees often injure themselves to receive ampules to fix preexisting wounds. Furthermore, these drones can fire decay ampules capable of melting human bodies at deserters leaving combat zones, or just for not attacking belligerents.

- Despite the K Corp ampule administration drone's significant combat utility (which according to research could raise the odds of victory by 23.5% in simulated battles), their high value (far surpassing 10 class 2 staff members) prevents their deployment outside of corporate buildings.

K Corp. had entered into various partnerships with other Wings due to their very potent technology, supplying SP Bullets which can heal sanity to R Corp's Reindeer Team and the HP-N Bullets for use in L Corp's main facility.

As shown by Dongrang, Helapoiesis is also used for meat production by repeatedly severing and regenerating parts of livestock. However, meat produced through this method seems to be unpopular.

Border Patrol
Because the Nest overseen by K Corp. is comparatively "one of the nicer" places to live in the City, just getting to the border checkpoint is a dangerous task onto itself. It is not uncommon to get ambushed and killed by hooligans trying to rob visas or IDs to even obtain a chance of moving into the Nest.

The interior of the border patrol checkpoint is almost completely stark white, with the corporation's signature green decorating the scant signage. The entrance fosters an incredibly oppressive atmosphere as languid-but-uncaring armed guards mercilessly bolster security.

Taboos
K Corp. is especially harsh with their border control laws, as at least one Taboo is known to warrant lethal force when broken.

Taboo K185: Upon damaging the glass barrier separating the Backstreet-resident line from the non-Backstreets line, the violation warrants a "Code Purple" where blaring purple lights begin flashing as metal shutters cover any remaining glass windows. Code Purple also prompts the deployment of Thrombocyte and Leukocyte security units.

On rarer occasions, K Corp's personal high-ranked Fixer, Siegfried, is dispatched for especially stubborn Taboo-breakers the checkpoint security has greater difficulty disposing.

Nest
Being one of the affluent Wings due to their Singularity, Nest life in District 11 is one of the more coveted goals anyone in the City could obtain. While life in this Nest is one of the more "sterile" experiences in the City, it is very much preferable for most due to how K Corp's wealth is able to afford its residents a more sheltered life with little strife. Still for some, the oppressively mundane daily routine can be stifling to many of its citizens — becoming listless as if they "lost focus, spacing out and staring into empty spaces". As seen with the incredibly apathetic border guards, it seems many residents struggle to find meaning with their lives in the Nest. District 11's corporate life is highly unforgiving: despite being said to care about employee well-being, K Corp has 70-hour work weeks and severely punishes defects or disobedient guard units.

The Nest is also well-off enough to afford orphanages to house children who've lost their parents, in grave contrast to most Backstreets with their high child-mortality rates for orphans. It's implied that this happens because their Singularity only records suffering in the City, so there's no shortage of fuel for their Singularity in anywhere else and allows them to be more lenient towards people in their quarters.


Calw
Calw (Hangul: 칼프, Kalpeu) was a small town located in K Corp’s Nest which was renowned for its prosthetic expertise, earning the nickname "The Holy Site of Nest K's Prosthetic Industry."

Due to the village specializing in the manufacture of high-end prosthesis components, it became a tradition in Calw to fully replace one's "outdated" body parts with prosthetics to become full-on cyborgs. The village was surrounded by scenic woodlands rarely found in the Backstreets, providing an almost idyllic landscape.

During the events of the game, Calw was destroyed on Christmas Eve, when the N Corp. Inquisition targeted the townspeople for their augmentations. Consequently, many inhabitants were executed or detained and tortured. The Inquisition then took refuge in the ruins of Branch K-02 buried under the burning mansion that was Sinclair's family home, transforming the ruined L Corp. facility into a base of operations on their hunt for the Golden Bough.

Eunbong’s Bar & Fryers
A family-owned restaurant in K Corp's Nest that was in competition with the Bodhisattva Chicken right across it. After losing customers to the neighbouring restaurant chain and having his secret recipe destroyed in a concept incinerator, the owner spiralled into madness and transformed into a Distortion known as Papa Bongy — sending out an army of raw chickens at Bodhisattva's customers.
The restaurant was named in memory after the owner's mother, Eunbong.

Bodhisattva Chicken
A popular restaurant chain famous for their six-legged, eight-winged poultry. Their chicken is advertised to be prepared "for every preference," with multiple cuts available. A location opened in K Corp's Nest a few months ago right across from Eunbong's Bar & Fryers, ruining their business. The manager of that location was indirectly responsible for creating the Papa Bongy Distortion after stealing Eunbong's secret recipe and destroying it in a concept incinerator.

Because of Papa Bongy's rampage, the Bodhisattva Chicken's Manager of the location became bedridden as the both businesses now suffered.

Smoke War
In the Smoke War, K Corp. was one of the Wings which opposed the stingy [[Businesses and Organizations/Old L Corp\|Old L Corp]]. responsible for the human-smelling smoke that polluted the City.

K Corp. alongside I Corp. and R Corp. colluded with Lobotomy Corporation to supersede the Old L Corp, who formed an alliance with E Corp, F Corp, and the Old G Corp.

I Corp. and K Corp. also lured in the employment of Fixers with the promise of Nest Migration Permits to naive Fixers who fought for them in the patent-war. These promises were eventually annulled when absurd amounts of money were put on the table to to rescind such agreements, leaving Smoke War veterans banned and snubbed from ever becoming Nest inhabitants due to their involvement.

K Corp. is split into multiple departments, at least two of which share a corporate building. Little is known about them, but a "department of the year" award exists.

**K Corp Security Staff:** Guards that manage the immigration process of citizens into K Corp's Nest, as well as general security roles. Individuals and small groups need a K Corp visa to pass, though you can also present a work visa and business statement instead if you belong to a company.  
  
Security Staff come in ranks of Class 1-3 (as of now). Class 1 composes of light security for riot control and response, while Class 3 are equipped with HP-infused exoskeletons and heavy weaponry. K Corp Security are also often backed up by automated drones who administer HP or Decay ampules, depending on the morale of the staff.  
  
When trouble occurs, the guards are not afraid to brutalize those who step out of line. They make use of K Corp's HP Bullets to outlast their foes. In the case of a taboo being broken, or an especially troubling incident occurs, heavier response units are sent in to suppress the offender with extreme prejudice.  
Outfit: Black tactical armor with neon Green accents.

Department of Food Resource Development
One of the many research departments at K Corp's laboratories, they are in charge of creating efficient ways to streamline the processing of food products, whether through genetic engineering or automated work.  
Outfit: Standard K Corp White lab coat and Black suit with Green trim.
