Sweepers
More so a collective of beings than a proper organization, the Sweepers are what every Backstreet denizen fears. Cannibals clad in gas masks and armored suits, they prowl the Streets after Night in droves to hunt down prey, butchering bodies to use as fuel for their ravaged selves.

They care not for who they hunt, Syndicate or Fixer, as anyone unfortunate enough to get in their way will be torn apart. They reside in hidden Dens when not actively hunting, where they gather, eat, and birth new Sweepers. A "Mother of Sweepers" lead these dens.

Sweepers have a unique condition in that their bodies are made entirely of liquid flesh. They maintain this form by melting flesh into liquid paste using their heat hooks, then they fill their tanks with the paste and connect it directly to their mask filters via tubes to slurp it. If this liquid runs out, the Sweeper dies. This technology is patented by the Head, those who wish to join the Sweepers must undergo this liquefying process and wear an armored suit like them.

Additionally, they are also capable of speaking their own language (something akin to binary), and have a basic understanding of concepts that would surprise most. They also share strong familial ties with fellow Sweepers.

Apparently they don't go to residential areas, whether this means they don't break into houses or outright avoid neighborhoods is unclear.
