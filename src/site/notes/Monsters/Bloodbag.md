Bloodbags are failed attempts of a blood fiend/kindred to turn a human into a blood fiend. Thus, they are used as human blood bags being viewed as only having the purpose of giving their blood to the kindred. 
It also occurs when a [[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]] that already has 2 sired kindred tries to sire another one (since 2 is the natural limit) or if they consciously do not sire the person they infect as their kindred.
