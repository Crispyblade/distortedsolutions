- Two fixers facing down Blood Red Night
Leaders:Â 24 Elder Bloodfiends (All First Kindreds).  
A lineage of vampires that trace their origin to a mysterious mansion, where they received the first blood from a Primogenitor, before eventually settling in the City. They decided to establish rules to ensure they could avoid detection and harvest blood inconspicuously, they even culled their numbers down to a select few. Settling in most Districts, each clan is led by an Elder, although there is the occasional rogue element that exposes themselves and causes havoc.  

There exists two generations of Bloodfiends. The originals who migrated to the City and hold the core values of familial respect and follow the rules set by the Elders, and the newer generation who manifested through the Distortion Phenomenon. The Distorted Bloodfiends do not share the values of the old guard, instead having little understanding and control of their powers, as well as causing unwanted chaos. Thus, there is common conflict between the two, as the former wish to remain in secrecy, while the new-bloods seek to expand their influence.  
  
Bloodfiends are ranked by generations of "Kindred", Those of the first few generations are the oldest and most powerful due to their pure blood, while the further numbered Kindred are lesser due to their diluted blood. Permission is needed from a senior "family" member to create more Kindred, due to the restrictions put in place by the Elders (Two Children per Kindred). In the original generation, due to the familial bond that ties them to one another, Kindred will seldom revolt or go against their elders, as it is against their very nature.  
  
Like vampires of myth, they harvest blood by extracting the veins of humans. Those who have their blood drained eventually turn into Bloodbags, mindless dregs who seek out blood sources with a ravenous fervor.  
To create more Kindred, it is likely one has to consciously make the decision right before biting, otherwise every victim would end up becoming Kindred. Bloodfiends are categorized as either those with a violent rampaging desire for blood, or those with cunning who manipulate and convert victims. The hungrier a Bloodfiend is, the deeper and clearer their red eyes will be.  
  
In battle, they rely on a combat style known as "Hardblood Arts". These techniques follow the manipulation and shaping of blood to form a variety of weapons such as lances, swords, fists, or projectiles. Usually Arts are inherited and taught from a First Kindred, which is then further diversified and evolved through their children. (Though it's possible Hardblood Arts are specifically unique to La Manchaland Bloodfiends, but there isn't enough evidence currently)  
  
To Bloodfiends, Blood is unique to them as it serves as a representation of different concepts, such as emotions, wealth, purpose, food. They can spend this "blood currency" to empower themselves, manifest weapons and armor, maintain their form, or for the reasons stated before. The relationship between Bloodfiends and blood can be likened to that of an addiction. One who is deprived of the sustenance for a long time will show symptoms such as dehydration, nausea, withering of the skin, and a ever-growing desire for blood that spirals into insanity. 
It is also theorized that blood is to a Bloodfiend the same as socializing for humans. While abstaining from blood may not kill a Bloodfiend, it will cause severe psychological damage.

Additionally, Bloodfiends have an intense irrational fear of water. The liquid is incapable of harming them, but they abhor it to the point of having spasms and convulsions if even so much of a drop gets on them, though some of the more powerful Kindred have managed to overcome said fear.

**A Bloodfiend can only ever create two Kindreds**. Anything else beyond that would presumably result in a [[Monsters/Bloodbag\|Bloodbag]]. 

Filiel Impiety is treated the same as a Bloodfiend's fear of water, going against a higher up feels "wrong" and is usually impossible. The higher up the bloodstream the more powerful a bloodfiend is.

**Bloodfiend War**  
A relatively old conflict between two sides of Bloodfiends, those who wished to coexist alongside humans in peace, and those who saw them only as prey and cattle. It seems the Peaceful Bloodfiends won the battle.

Bloodfiends must lie in secrecy or be risked a visit by hunters, such as [[Fixers/Offices/Fanghunt Office\|Fanghunt Office]]
