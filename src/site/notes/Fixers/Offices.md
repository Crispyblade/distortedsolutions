Offices

The starting point for all Fixers, Offices are a small organized group of Fixers that work out of a building or location, taking contracts and jobs from the public. An Operator or Representative handles the managing of the Office, hiring new recruits and such.  
Offices are often swamped in debt to the Wings, with some poor state Offices handled by only one Fixer, which says a lot about how hit or miss the business can be. This isn't to say all Offices are worn down though, it all depends on the financial state of the Office and its location.  
  
Offices can also chose to become a "Affiliate Office" with an Association. They get access to better amenities, but must also contend with higher risk jobs and more responsibilities. Which is often a point of contention for many.  
  
Most Offices and Associations give guidelines for their Fixers to wear outfits fitting in with the organization's theme. Some are more strict with regulating uniforms, while others are more lax.
