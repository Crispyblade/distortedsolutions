"The whole market’s a red ocean. Everyone wants to be a Fixer" -Roland

Fixers are contract mercenaries, mostly a demand in the Backstreets, due to the high mortality rate and crime, though they appear in the Nests too. Fixers often work as security for Corps, intel-gatherers, and hitmen.  
  
Fixers work by signing contracts with their clients, this is proof of the deed done so that [[Fixers/Associations\|Associations]] or [[Fixers/Offices\|Offices]] can confirm that you did the work. Otherwise you won't get paid for it, completed contracts means more recognition for a Fixer's career, which will rise them through the ranks.  
  
Due to the nature of Fixer work, social bonding isn't typically a common thing. Seeing a dead colleague who was once your friend ends up messing up your focus and drags you through depression. As a result, veteran Fixers often focus on the task at hand, pushing away any sentimental thoughts.

Becoming a Fixer

To become a Fixer, one must obtain a "Fixer License" from the Hana Association. To get the license, you'll have to meet the physical and mental requirements (Age 20 is the minimum). After that, you should join one of the Offices. You can also strike out and take jobs on your own, but your very unlikely to make headway, as having the reputation of an Office boosts your chances for jobs considerably.  
  
Most of the Offices are independent, others align themselves with one of the 12 Associations as part of a cooperative relationship. Fixers can join Associations too for the better benefits, but the requirements are high.  
  
Fixers are ranked by "Grades" from 9-1, 9 is the lowest Grade, with 1 being the highest. To earn a new Grade, one must have a high performance during their work, the better you are, the faster you'll rise up the ranks. Having proof of your deeds is also essential, otherwise you'd have done that hard work for nothing.  
  
The Hana [[Fixers/Associations\|Associations]] will then send an approval to your Association or Office to elevate your "Grade". The equipment of a Fixer typically reflects their wealth and Grade, low ranks will often have basic weapons and outfits. While higher ranked ones will have customized loadouts and multiple augmentations.

"Fixers are an official profession in the city. A Fixer’s grade is given to them by the Hana Association, an Association that oversees ALL Fixers in the city.

A total beginner starts out as a Grade 9, meaning that they are untested novices. They typically work odd jobs, and are usually hired by the desperate, or if bodies are needed more than skills.

Once a Grade 9 has succeeded enough, Hana deems them to be better than novices and they start to gain Rank. They get more pay, allowing them to upgrade their gear, augment their bodies, and work their way up the Fixer ladder.

As they gain experience, they typically figure out what they are good at and join one of the Associations that specializes in their strengths. This can be combat oriented, such as One-on-One duels, one-vs-many brawls, team-vs-team fights, bodyguard work, and stealthy assassinations, or non-combat tasks, such as information gathering, handling bureaucratic contracts, or inspecting/approving weapon Research and Development done by Workshops around the City.

Alternatively, if they don’t want to join an Association, a Fixer can either open their own Office and hire a team of slightly lower Grade Fixers to work with (which is very expensive), or join up with an existing Office in hopes of improving their skills, making connections, and getting opportunities that are not available to Solo Fixers. These Offices are semi-autonomous, but still work under an Association that has a similar purpose, and have to follow their guidelines. An Office working under the Zwei Association, for example, will typically get peacekeeping and bodyguard work, while an office working under the Shi Asdociation will typically get stealthy Assassination jobs, for example.

As they gain enough working experience by doing harder and more complex jobs well, they work their way up to Grade 1, which is the top of the normal Hierarchy. At that point, their only chance at furthering their Careers is to be so famous for their skill in their field that the Hana Association recognized them on an official level and assigns them a Color.

A Color rank tells potential clients that this Fixer is the best of the best in their field. This can mean anything from “this person can kill an entire platoon of highly trained and heavily armed soldiers with his bare hands without breaking a sweat” to “this person can draft the perfect contract that will make every party get everything that they want with no downsides, except for that one guy that you want to intentionally screw over, regardless of their rank or social standing, and can easily enforce it without anyone needing to throw a single punch”. With results like that, they are typically very expensive to hire, and they may still turn you down if they don’t want to do the job, because they are their own boss. With that said, the previous Red Fixer, the Red Mist, was famous for taking difficult jobs from the underprivileged and doing it for free, so you don’t necessarily need to be rich to hire one. Unlike most Fixers who are forced to work in an Office or Association to make ends meet, Color Fixers are their own boss, and have the freedom to take whatever job they want and do what they want (within reason), rather than what an Office or Association assigns them.

The Hana Association will not readily give out Color ranks, because a poorly chosen Color that underperforms or goes rogue will reflect poorly on their Association and Fixers in general, so you know that they are the best of the best at their field when you hire one."
