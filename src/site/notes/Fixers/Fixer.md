"The whole marketâ€™s a red ocean. Everyone wants to be a Fixer" -Roland

Fixers are contract mercenaries, mostly a demand in the Backstreets, due to the high mortality rate and crime, though they appear in the Nests too. Fixers often work as security for Corps, intel-gatherers, and hitmen.  
  
Fixers work by signing contracts with their clients, this is proof of the deed done so that [[Fixers/Associations\|Associations]] or [[Fixers/Offices\|Offices]] can confirm that you did the work. Otherwise you won't get paid for it, completed contracts means more recognition for a Fixer's career, which will rise them through the ranks.  
  
Due to the nature of Fixer work, social bonding isn't typically a common thing. Seeing a dead colleague who was once your friend ends up messing up your focus and drags you through depression. As a result, veteran Fixers often focus on the task at hand, pushing away any sentimental thoughts.

Becoming a Fixer

To become a Fixer, one must obtain a "Fixer License" from the Hana Association. To get the license, you'll have to meet the physical and mental requirements (Age 20 is the minimum). After that, you should join one of the Offices. You can also strike out and take jobs on your own, but your very unlikely to make headway, as having the reputation of an Office boosts your chances for jobs considerably.  
  
Most of the Offices are independent, others align themselves with one of the 12 Associations as part of a cooperative relationship. Fixers can join Associations too for the better benefits, but the requirements are high.  
  
Fixers are ranked by "Grades" from 9-1, 9 is the lowest Grade, with 1 being the highest. To earn a new Grade, one must have a high performance during their work, the better you are, the faster you'll rise up the ranks. Having proof of your deeds is also essential, otherwise you'd have done that hard work for nothing.  
  
The Hana [[Fixers/Associations\|Associations]] will then send an approval to your Association or Office to elevate your "Grade". The equipment of a Fixer typically reflects their wealth and Grade, low ranks will often have basic weapons and outfits. While higher ranked ones will have customized loadouts and multiple augmentations.
