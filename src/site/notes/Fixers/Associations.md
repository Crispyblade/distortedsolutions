The Associations

The Associations are large professional organizations made up of Fixers and their managers, they specialize in the more dangerous line of mercenary work, taking jobs no one else wants to. Though this isn't to say they don't take non-combat jobs. They help manage most of the offices under their contract, and have much higher pay and better equipment than a basic Office.  
  
To enlist in an Association, a Fixer must take some introductory training before then taking an entrance exam, a simple task that tests the examinees on whether they're fit to be a part of the Association.  
Due to their larger structure, Associations are able to cover more ground with their Fixers and can take requests from any District. Most of the headquarters of said Associations are likely based in Nests, where Directors and Fixers manage requests from either the City's denizens or Affiliate Offices.  
  
A President is the head of an Association, this is split into several Branches that oversee the different parts of the City: North, South, East, and West. These are run by a Branch Manager, while a General Manager directly oversees all branches. these are further divided into Sections, which is run by a Director. Sections are ranked from 6-1, 6 being the lowest recruits and 1 being the highest ranking Fixers. Sections 6 and 5 typically have lower quality clothing and armor than those of 4 and above.  
  
There are currently 12 Associations, which are managed by the [[Hana Association\|Hana Association]], and they all have different uniforms, rules, and specializations in their line of work.
