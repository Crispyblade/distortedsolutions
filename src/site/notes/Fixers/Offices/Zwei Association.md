Zwei Association: German (2) Their motto being: "Your Shield".
As their name implies, Zwei Association uses their signature Zweihander swords in combat. They're primarily a defense-oriented Association, as they take protection jobs in the Backstreets for clients seeking safety from Syndicates and crazed murderers.

Being a public safety Association, Zwei is responsible for safeguarding citizens and bringing justice to criminal Syndicates and lawbreakers. Similar to police organizations, they also have a variety of special units that investigate criminal activity or defend client locations.

Most members believe their service provides proper justice and order to the City, as a result, they detest the Syndicates and Fingers who exploit the innocent. Of course, Zwei usually only protects those who have paid a contract with them to begin with.

-The West branch has a knightly design with armor plating and tassets, longskirts, or tabards in either a Blue or White color scheme.
