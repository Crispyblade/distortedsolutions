Operator: [[Players/Mercer\|Mercer]] (?)

An up and coming grade 9 [[Fixers/Fixer\|Fixer]] office.
They don't discriminate when it comes to hiring oddballs, such as [[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|bloodfiend]]s and reformed [[Monsters/Distortion\|Distortion]]s, leading to most normal people giving them a wide berth and making rookie [[Fixers/Fixer\|Fixer]]s and [[Syndicates\|Syndicates]] view them as an easy rep boost.

They've set up shop in [[Geography and Politics/District\|District]] 23, and have been operating for around a year.
