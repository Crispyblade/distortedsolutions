Operator: Romero
One of the Offices that specializes in hunting down Bloodfiends, they use weapons designed against [[Monsters/Bloodfiend\|Bloodfiend]]-type foes. Some of their members take pride in their task of rooting out the vampires, to the point where they'll dismiss and discourage those who they believe are ill-prepared for the hunt.
Like most Hunters, they abhor Bloodfiends, believing they aren't even human and thus, do not deserve any mercy.
Outfit: Dark Grey Gothic coats with White accents. They also have various belts, buckles, and pockets.
