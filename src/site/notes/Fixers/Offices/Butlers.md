A classification of Fixers who work as contracted, long-term household security and servants for wealthy families or individuals. They deal in the usual house-care tasks assigned to them, but can also serve in combat roles thanks to their Fixer background. They are led by a Chief Butler. Butlers also have very hefty financial salaries and benefits, to the point where many veteran Association Fixers retire as Butlers.  
Outfit:Â Maid uniforms for women, buttoned suits for men (though suits can also be worn by women).
