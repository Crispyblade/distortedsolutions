If a highly regarded Grade 1 Fixer shows an exceedingly exceptional performance in their career, the Hana Association can choose them to be granted a "Color." These special Color Fixers are the legendary talk of the City, possessing unmatched skill and wits. They are able to roam freely and accept any work they want, not bound by Associations or Offices.

While all Color Fixers are powerful, they all have different fighting styles and scale in terms of strength and smarts. The Red Mist for example, is best when fighting a direct confrontation, while the Blue Reverberation manipulates and uses others to do most of his work for him.

The Red Mist: Kali (Missing)
Known to be "The Strongest Fixer". Having grown up in the harsh Backstreets of District 23, she vowed to protect the weak and those unable to fight the bloodthirsty Syndicates and Fingers. Named for the fine red mist of blood and gore she leaves in her wake, she excels in close quarters combat and direct battle, using a hefty greatsword to slice opponents from any direction.
The Red Mist was often hailed as a hero for one who fought for the downtrodden and the oppressed, her legendary reputation still talked about today.

**The Red Gaze: Vergilius**  
The new holder of the "Red" color. Known as "The Most Dangerous Fixer", He has a cold and hardened demeanor, which, combined with his imposing stature, makes him a rather intimidating man. Though, close friends of his see a more softer side rarely shown. His color name is derived from the red glow of his eyes when he gets serious or angry. He wields a heated Gladius in combat, and uses it to deadly efficiency. Vergilius uses mental tactics to discern and deconstruct combat scenarios, picking the best course of action to defeat his foes.

**The Blue Reverberation: Argalia (Deceased)**  
While not as strong as some of the other Colors, he makes up for it with his charisma and influence. Through this he is capable of gathering devoted followers as well as manipulating high ranking Association and Syndicate leaders. He also possesses quick reflexes that enable him to deflect bullets with ease. His main ability is tapping into one's "Resonance", then attuning it with his weapon to inflict greater damage.  
  
Argalia was ousted from his Color Fixer position due to his creation of the "Reverb Ensemble" which would cause havoc among several Associations and within District 12. They would eventually be defeated by the Library.

**The Purple Tear: Iori**  
A seasoned Fixer who has seen countless battles, she is capable of teleporting herself by creating dimensional rifts. Wielding a variety of different weapon styles, she can adapt to any given situation. Because of her extensive experience and age, she mentored a few of the other Color Fixers when they were young. She is also quite cunning and is able to manipulate and plan far ahead towards her goals.

**The Black Silence (Missing)**  
A mysterious but powerful Fixer who was responsible for taking out the Pianist Distortion. Was known for using a wide variety of weapons from various Workshops around the City. Able to manifest said weapons using a special set of gloves. Although they went on a rampage that claimed the lives of Syndicates and researchers alike, they disappeared one day.  
  
**The Vermilion Cross (Deceased)**  
A Color Fixer dispatched alongside Hana South Section 1 to eliminate a Distortion organization. Unfortunatly, the entire team was wiped out. He used a large cross-shaped weapon that burns opponents.  
  
**The Indigo Elder**  
An old man in a rain coat wielding a massive harpoon gun, he travels the Great Lake hunting for the Five Great Calamities in a small but extremely durable oar boat. His strength is exceptional, having felled the Marlin Whale by himself and even beating out a Big Brother of the Middle. He seeks to test the limits of the dangers of the Outskirts, and even the eldritch horrors beyond.
