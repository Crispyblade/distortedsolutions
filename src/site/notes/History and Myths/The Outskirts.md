Located at the fringes of society, the Outskirts are a barren wasteland, covered with bombed-out cities left from the conflicts of the Wings. The Outskirts are separated from the City by the various train-ways and walls surrounding the perimeter. Not many citizens are typically aware of the Outskirts and its denizens, especially those living in Nest life.

There are hardly any signs of civil life, the only humans that live in the Outskirts are either outcasts, orphan children from the wars, or cannibals such as Sweepers. Although small towns of people do band together to survive, they have to endure constant raids from monsters.

However, there are still prospects to be found by exploring the Outskirts, strange and abnormal beings (usually plants) and technology can be found tucked away in the decrepit buildings. Some of these are harmful, others beneficial, granting boons or curses upon those who discover them. Because of this, Wings or other corporations will send out expeditions to retrieve these forgotten relics.

Creatures and other mutated aberrations of significant threat dwell here. Military corporations such as R Corp are typically sent here and the Ruins for missions. Most creatures are discarded experiments from the Wings, or monsters from the fringes of the world.

Overview
Outside of the 25 visible districts lies the Outskirts, a no man's land known mostly by citizens of the City as somewhere they should never go to. It is said to be primarily populated by Sweepers and abandoned children, however supposedly also possessing a variety of dangerous Monsters not dissimilar to Abnormalities. The Outskirts is also known for being home to cryptic creatures known as Clockwork Teeth. Few people know more about the Outskirts than this, and even fewer desire to ever see it for themselves, although some, like Demian, claim it to be a better, freer place than the City altogether.

A woodland by the name of the Black Forest is said to be located somewhere within the Outskirts. Additionally, the Outskirts overlaps with the Great Lake, allowing creatures such as the Pallid Whale to swim between the two. A large train also runs along the edge between it and the City.

The major known use of the Outskirts is by the Head themselves, as it appears to be used as a dump where they drive out anything they deem to be impurities. Beyond the Head's use, the Wings and its citizens will sometimes use it as a depot for unwanted children. It is not uncommon for children to be left in the Outskirts after being experimented on by a Wing, while taking in children from the Outskirts into the City requires an extremely complicated procedure. Others may find the Outskirts an alluring place to set up camp specifically due to its distance from the Head's watchful eye
