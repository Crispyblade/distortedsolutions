The Head

The 1st Wing, known as "The Head", is a mysterious organization that rules all of the Wings and Districts, they reside in District 1, at the heart of the City. They maintain their iron grip through their Singularity and various subsidiaries that enforce their will. They also directly manage A Corp, which is an extension of the Head's will that properly manages the City.  
In a way, the "Head" is made up of three Corporations, A Corp, B Corp, and C Corp, run by the Head, Eye, and Claw respectively.  
  
A reclusive group, the Head's identity is completely unknown. No one even knows much about District 1. Anyone who violates the laws of the City or attempt to further discover the Head's identity quickly and quietly disappear.  
  
For handling threats or securing dangerous artifacts the Head uses the "Arbiters", Singularity-infused assassins whose power surpass even Grade 1 Fixers, a single one can lay waste to an entire corporation.  
  
The Eye handles the surveillance network that watches over the City, anything detected that is deemed against the Head's laws will be reported immediately. They also use special operatives called "Beholders" to assist in more physical matters and field work. They appear as digitized forms on portable projector screens, whether this is their "true" body or not is unknown.  
  
The Claw is the military branch of the Head, they command the "Executioners", augmented super soldiers that follow orders with unwavering obedience and ferocity. They use a mechanical claw arm to tear and rend foes asunder, and when a Executioner is put to their limit, they use a choice of three serums to greatly empower themselves. These serums are selected from Singularities, such as W, K, and R Corp.  
  
The Head, and by extension the Wings, all tax the City for nearly every service. Its nearly impossible to not have to pay taxes for something, whether that be food, rent, or services. Their also rather expensive, which lead people to attempting to find ways to earn a steady income through whatever means.  
Refusing taxes will result in 4 warnings, if the fourth is ignored, the Eyes will send "Tax Collectors" to track down and kill the evader.  
The Head also uses various other patented technology asides from their Singularity, such as the "flesh liquidation" process for turning people into Sweepers.  
  
When the Head designates a threat as an "Impurity", they can banish it to the Outskirts by using the Territory Expulsion Procedure. Through this method, anything from singular entities to entire structures can be instantly teleported to the wastes.
