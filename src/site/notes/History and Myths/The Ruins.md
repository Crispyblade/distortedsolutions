The Ruins
The Ruins possibly refer to either the ominous eldritch landscape beyond the Outskirts, or the forgotten Ruins of the Old Corporations underneath the City. The's City's Ruins are different in that the threat level increases as you go deeper, while the Outskirt's Ruins contain things incomprehensible to the human mind. Expeditions sent here have a low chance of survival, and those that do are often shaken from the experience.

Since these are one of the most dangerous places to go to, its quite possible the forbidden relics and technology found here would be worth killing for. There is also supposedly "Magic" in the Ruins, artifacts containing unknown powers that can unleash potent effects.
