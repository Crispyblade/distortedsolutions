The Library is a library made from the Seed of Light and the remains of Facility X-394 of Lobotomy Corporation. It resides in the middle of the Nest of District 12, replacing the original Headquarters of L Corp, now a fallen Wing. Angela is the director of the Library and its creator, able to control the power within the Library along with the other Patron Librarians.

The Library is portrayed as a large, towering structure composed of 10 Floors that contains infinite internal space. It focuses on storing Books from the people who die inside it. To access the Library, an Invitation has to be used, and those who sign the Invitation become the Guests. The Invitation offers Books of interest of the Guests, and if they do survive the ordeals within the Library, they can take the Books and leave. Otherwise, they will become Books.

Since the Library only has control of its interior and limited ways to influence the outside world, Invitations are created and used to reach out to the people who will be its designated targets. Those invited by The Library's Invitation are called Guests. The Invitations use Books which are of interest to the Guests being invited, under conditions in which acceptance is almost guaranteed. Even if the Invitation can be given to another person, it will always reach its designated group of Guests by some turn of events.

Once someone has signed the Invitation, a door will appear and take the group to the Library, phasing out immediately. It can be in any place and under any sort of conditions, as long the involved people who are going to the Library are the ones who signed the envelope.

The Guests must face an ordeal inside the Library, taken into a Reception, where they will face the Librarians who must fight them. Once one side has fallen, the act of the Reception will end. If the Guests survive, they will take the Books and leave. If the Librarians defend successfully, the Guests are turned into Books.

After being declared an Impurity by [[History and Myths/The Head\|The Head]] the Library was moved into the Ruins by the Head. Additionally, all killed by The Library found themselves revived in [[Geography and Politics/The City\|The City]] after the Library was evicted.
