The City (tm) is the main setting. Surrounding The City are [[History and Myths/The Outskirts\|The Outskirts]] and [[History and Myths/The Ruins\|The Ruins]]. Each has its own awful abominations but the city is generally considered the safest. For example the outskirts has a Santas workshop except the gnomes there kidnap people and turn them into furniture and toys. The ruins are unknowable eldritch abominations. The city you might just get organ harvested on a bad day or cannibalized, or get splattered by a monster / distortion, or if you're really lucky die instantly.

The City is broken into 26 [[Geography and Politics/District\|District]]s, each with [[Businesses and Organizations/Nests\|Nests]] and [[Geography and Politics/Backstreets\|Backstreets]], managed by  [[Businesses and Organizations/Wings\|Wings]]. Each district is managed by a corporation that provides an essential service. All the corps are named after a letter of the alphabet and each district is named numerically (A corp is district 1)
An example is L or Lobotomy Corp. This destroyed corporation produced energy for the entire city via the use of a singularity (reality warping technology that each corp has).
[[Businesses and Organizations/Nests\|Nests]] are "idealistic societies" where everyone basically works a 9-5 office job. Nests are built above the backstreets (think FF7 Midgar), and each corporations job (known as feathers) nurture their nests. 

The general power scale (pecking order) is
Grade 9
Grade 8
Descending to Grade 1
The 5 fingers of the city ([[Syndicates\|Syndicates]])
[[Fixers/Colors\|Colors]] (there is exactly one of each color alive at a time)
Some Corps
[[History and Myths/The Head\|The Head]]
