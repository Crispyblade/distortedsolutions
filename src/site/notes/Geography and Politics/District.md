In the City, there are 26 Districts. In a District is both the Nest and Backstreets belonging to their respective Wing. All Districts are interconnected through the WARP Transportation Network via train.  
  
Oddly enough, there does not appear to be a "Z Corp" and by extension, District 26, visible on the map, it is unknown what this means.  
  
Each District has its own unique culture and customs, so its always a different experience from each other. The northern districts tend to be more richer and developed than the south.

There is approximately around 6-7 billion people within the City, the accepted currency is Ahn, which can come in either physical or digital cash. The year is 985.  
  
All Districts typically have a set of rules citizens must follow at all times. They vary on the District, but the punishment for breaking them is usually death or capture by the associated Corp. There is one rule that applies to the entire City at all times however. Under no circumstance can any part of a residential building or complex be damaged or destroyed, certain walls or fences are an exception, but anything part of a home or building is strictly off-limits.
