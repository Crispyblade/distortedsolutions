The Backstreets are the areas of a [[Businesses and Organizations/Wings\|Wings]] [[Geography and Politics/District\|District]] that are not included in the [[Businesses and Organizations/Nests\|Nests]], outside of their protection — being the poverty-ridden areas of [[Geography and Politics/The City\|the City]].

Overview
The residents are mostly people who cannot afford to live in the Nest, and are forced to fight for themselves in order to survive. It's not uncommon for unscrupulous hooligans to band together to form gangs known as [[Syndicates/Syndicate\|Syndicate]]s to rule over the Backstreets, as the [[Five Fingers\|Five Fingers]] — consisting of Star of the City-level Syndicates — wield enough power to allegedly rival the Wings.

These dumps ultimately serve a clear purpose: Backstreets citizens are motivated to work hard so that they might one day move out of the Backstreets and into a Nest, and Nest citizens are motivated to work hard so that they may continue to live in a Nest and not get dumped into the Backstreets.

Night in the Backstreets
The Backstreets are known for having a special, lawless time period known as the "Night in the Backstreets" , ranging from 3:13 AM to 4:34 AM.

During this 81 minute period, anything goes, and it is prohibited to record any of the events which occur throughout this duration. [[Monsters/Sweepers\|Sweepers]] will appear in waves and scour the area in order to clear out corpses and other loose remnants of the prior day, such as weapons.

Because of this, it is highly recommended that citizens of the Backstreets avoid being out in the open during nighttime.
